👨🏻‍💻 I'm a first year PhD student in Economics at the University of Cologne.

🔬 My research interests are in Sports Economics, Urban Economics, and Applied Microeconometrics!

📚 I have a particular interest in exploring the tangible and intanbible effects of professional sports teams/facilites and major sporting events. Specifically, I aim to carve out the underlying market idiosyncrasies allowing to embed sports facilities and teams as urban amenities. 

# Current Projects
## Working Papers
1. The Relocation Effect of a Major League Franchise on Residential Property Values - Quantifying the Intangible (Dis-) Benefits Generated by the Departure of the NFL’s Rams Franchise from St. Louis [Link](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/)

## Collaborations
Feel free to reach out to exchange ideas about future research projects in the field :)

# 📚 Teaching
I currently teach a project course for bachelor students in Economics: \textit{Empirical Replications in Sports Economics}. The aim of the class is to introduce students to the field of sports economics and become familiar with the underpinnings of conducting empirical research in Economics by replicating selected papers in R.
