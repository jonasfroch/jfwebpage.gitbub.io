I had the pleasure to be interviewed by Adam Magyar from Euronews. I discussed that while the direct, i.e. tangible economic impact of major sporting events, that is the impact in income and employment is vastly neglectable owing to substitution and crowding-out effects, the indirect, i.e. intangible effects could be substantially large as the experience of the "Sommermärchen", the FIFA World Cup in 2006 in Germany has taught us. In particular increases in civic price and social cohesion and implictly enhance living quality may be observed during major sporting events.
